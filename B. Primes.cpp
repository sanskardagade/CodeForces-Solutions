/*A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 and has exactly 2 divisors which are 1 and the number itself.You are given a prime number n, find any 2 prime numbers a and b such that a+b=n or state that no such pair of primes exists.

Input
The input contains a single prime number n
(2≤n≤107
).

Output
If there doesn't exist any 2 primes such that their summation is equal to n then print -1, otherwise print the 2 primes on a single line separated by a space. 

Examples
